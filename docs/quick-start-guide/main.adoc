= Quick Start Guide

This Quick Start Guide helps administrators and developers with installing, and accessing the OpenShift Database Access service.
The OpenShift Database Access operator enables you to do the following:

* Easy consumption of database-as-a-service (DBaaS) offerings from partners including MongoDB Atlas, Crunchy Bridge, CockroachDB, and Amazon's Relational Database Services (RDS) directly from managed OpenShift clusters.
* Easy management, monitoring, and control by administrators of cloud-hosted DBaaS including consumption, usage, and status.

[id="accessing-the-database-access-menu-for-configuring-and-monitoring"]

== Accessing the Database Access menu for configuring and monitoring

From the OpenShift console, you can access the OpenShift Database Access navigation menu.
On the Database Access page, use the appropriate project namespace for importing a cloud-database provider account.

[IMPORTANT]
====
By using MongoDB Atlas as a cloud-database provider, you must add the IP address of the application pod to MongoDB Atlas' **IP Access List**.
If the IP address is not in the **IP Access List**, then a `504 gateway timeout error` occurs.
Visit the MongoDB Atlas link:https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/security/ip-access-list/[website] for more details on adding an IP address to your database project.
====

[NOTE]
====
After creating a _DBaaSPolicy_ as a non-administrative user, on the *Operator details* page, under the *Provider Account Policy* section, you will see a restricted access message.
By selecting *Current namespace only* option, you can view the policies.

====
Amazon only allows two secret access keys for each user.
You might need to deactivate unused keys, or delete lost keys before you can create a new access key.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You are limited to one Amazon RDS provider account per OpenShift cluster.
Using your AWS credentials on more than one OpenShift cluster breaks established connections on all OpenShift clusters, except for the last OpenShift cluster that established a connection.
====

IMPORTANT: OpenShift Database Access only supports RDS database **instance deployments**, and does not support database **cluster deployments**.

IMPORTANT: Database instances using a custom Oracle or custom SQL Server engine type are not supported.

.Prerequisites

* An Amazon Web Services link:https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=header_signup&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start/email[(AWS) account name].
